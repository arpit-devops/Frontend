    <!--  this is example of internal/inline css, means css code is written here as well, 
           but it make file large so we use external css file
    <style>
        /* css code */
    </style>

    simillary we can use internal/inline javascript code as well
    <script>
        // javascript code
    </script>
    
    so html file can have 3 types of code in same file, but it is not recommended
    1. html
    2. css
    3. javascript
