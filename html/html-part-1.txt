<div class="container">  </div> 

<> --> opening tag 
</> --> closing tag

Elements  (sometime also called as tags)
    div
    head
    body
    section
    strong 
    h1
    p
    main
    header
    footer
    .... and many more

Attribute
    class --> may be attached to multiple elements, denoted by '.' like .myclass
    id   --> unique for element, demoted by '#' like #myid
    style
    lang
